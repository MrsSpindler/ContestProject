# CCCProject

To participate in the CCC, you will need to use the Scanner class for input and the System class for output. 

Submissions using Java must be in the class Main.java in the default package. Additional packages are provided to permit you to work on multiple problems during the 3 hour contest.  Always ensure that the current submission is in the default package (no package declaration)
